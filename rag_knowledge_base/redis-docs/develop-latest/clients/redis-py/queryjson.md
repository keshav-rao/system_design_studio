This example shows how to create a
[search index](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/indexing)
for [JSON](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/json) documents and
run queries against the index. It then goes on to show the slight differences
in the equivalent code for [hash](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/hashes)
documents.

> [!NOTE]
> From [v6.0.0](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/releases/tag/v6.0.0) onwards,
> `redis-py` uses query dialect 2 by default.
> Redis Search methods such as [`ft().search()`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/ft.search)
> will explicitly request this dialect, overriding the default set for the server.

## Initialize

Make sure that you have [Redis Open Source](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack)
or another Redis server available. Also install the
[`redis-py`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/redis-py) client library if you
haven't already done so.

Add the following dependencies. All of them are applicable to both JSON and hash,
except for the `Path` class, which is specific to JSON (see
[Path](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/json/path) for a description of the
JSON path syntax).

Foundational: Import required libraries for Redis Search, JSON operations, and search functionality

```python
import redis
from redis.commands.json.path import Path
import redis.commands.search.aggregation as aggregations
import redis.commands.search.reducers as reducers
from redis.commands.search.field import TextField, NumericField, TagField
from redis.commands.search.index_definition import IndexDefinition, IndexType
from redis.commands.search.query import Query
import redis.exceptions
```



## Create data

Create some test data to add to your database. The example data shown
below is compatible with both JSON and hash objects.

Foundational: Define sample user data structures for indexing and querying

```python
user1 = {
    "name": "Paul John",
    "email": "paul.john@example.com",
    "age": 42,
    "city": "London"
}

user2 = {
    "name": "Eden Zamir",
    "email": "eden.zamir@example.com",
    "age": 29,
    "city": "Tel Aviv"
}

user3 = {
    "name": "Paul Zamir",
    "email": "paul.zamir@example.com",
    "age": 35,
    "city": "Tel Aviv"
}
```



## Add the index

Connect to your Redis database. The code below shows the most
basic connection but see
[Connect to the server](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/redis-py/connect)
to learn more about the available connection options.

Foundational: Establish a connection to a Redis server for query operations

```python
r = redis.Redis(decode_responses=True)
```



The example uses an index called `idx:users` for JSON documents and adds
some JSON documents with the `user:` key prefix. To avoid errors, first
delete any existing index or documents whose names that might
conflict with the example:

Foundational: Clean up existing indexes and documents to prepare for fresh example data

```python
try:
    r.ft("idx:users").dropindex(True)
except redis.exceptions.ResponseError:
    pass

r.delete("user:1", "user:2", "user:3")
```



Create an index for the JSON data. The code below specifies that only JSON documents with
the key prefix `user:` are indexed. For more information, see
[Query syntax](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/query).

Foundational: Create a search index for JSON documents with field definitions and key prefix filtering

```python
schema = (
    TextField("$.name", as_name="name"),
    TagField("$.city", as_name="city"),
    NumericField("$.age", as_name="age")
)

indexCreated = r.ft("idx:users").create_index(
    schema,
    definition=IndexDefinition(
        prefix=["user:"], index_type=IndexType.JSON
    )
)
```



## Add the data

Add the three sets of user data to the database as
[JSON](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/json) objects.
If you use keys with the `user:` prefix then Redis will index the
objects automatically as you add them:

Foundational: Store JSON documents in Redis with automatic indexing based on key prefix

```python
user1Set = r.json().set("user:1", Path.root_path(), user1)
user2Set = r.json().set("user:2", Path.root_path(), user2)
user3Set = r.json().set("user:3", Path.root_path(), user3)
```



## Query the data

You can now use the index to search the JSON objects. The
[query](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/query)
below searches for objects that have the text "Paul" in any field
and have an `age` value in the range 30 to 40:

Query with filters: Search JSON documents using text matching and numeric range filters to find specific records

```python
findPaulResult = r.ft("idx:users").search(
    Query("Paul @age:[30 40]")
)

print(findPaulResult)
# >>> Result{1 total, docs: [Document {'id': 'user:3', ...
```




Specify query options to return only the `city` field:

Query with field projection: Retrieve only specific fields from search results to reduce data transfer

```python
citiesResult = r.ft("idx:users").search(
    Query("Paul").return_field("$.city", as_field="city")
).docs

print(citiesResult)
# >>> [Document {'id': 'user:1', 'payload': None, ...
```




Use an
[aggregation query](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/query/aggregation)
to count all users in each city.

Aggregation queries: Use GROUP BY and COUNT operations to summarize and analyze indexed data

```python
req = aggregations.AggregateRequest("*").group_by(
    '@city', reducers.count().alias('count')
)

aggResult = r.ft("idx:users").aggregate(req).rows
print(aggResult)
# >>> [['city', 'London', 'count', '1'], ['city', 'Tel Aviv', 'count', '2']]
```



## Differences with hash documents

Indexing for hash documents is very similar to JSON indexing but you
need to specify some slightly different options.

When you create the schema for a hash index, you don't need to
add aliases for the fields, since you use the basic names to access
the fields anyway. Also, you must use `HASH` for the `IndexType`
when you create the index.

First delete any existing index or documents
whose names might conflict with the hash example:

Foundational: Clean up existing hash indexes and documents to prepare for fresh example data

```python
try:
    r.ft("hash-idx:users").dropindex(True)
except redis.exceptions.ResponseError:
    pass

r.delete("huser:1", "huser:2", "huser:3")
```




Create a new index called `hash-idx:users`, which is otherwise the same as
the `idx:users` index used for JSON documents in the previous examples:

Foundational: Create a search index for hash documents with HASH index type and field definitions

```python
hashSchema = (
    TextField("name"),
    TagField("city"),
    NumericField("age")
)

hashIndexCreated = r.ft("hash-idx:users").create_index(
    hashSchema,
    definition=IndexDefinition(
        prefix=["huser:"], index_type=IndexType.HASH
    )
)
```




You use [`hset()`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/hset) to add the hash
documents instead of [`json().set()`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/json.set),
but the same flat `userX` dictionaries work equally well with either
hash or JSON:

Foundational: Store hash documents in Redis with automatic indexing based on key prefix

```python
huser1Set = r.hset("huser:1", mapping=user1)
huser2Set = r.hset("huser:2", mapping=user2)
huser3Set = r.hset("huser:3", mapping=user3)
```



The query commands work the same here for hash as they do for JSON (but
the name of the hash index is different). The format of the result is
almost the same except that the fields are returned directly in the
result `Document` object instead of in an enclosing `json` dictionary:

Query with filters: Search hash documents using text matching and numeric range filters (same as JSON queries)

```python
findPaulHashResult = r.ft("hash-idx:users").search(
    Query("Paul @age:[30 40]")
)

print(findPaulHashResult)
# >>> Result{1 total, docs: [Document {'id': 'huser:3',
# >>>   'payload': None, 'name': 'Paul Zamir', ...
```
