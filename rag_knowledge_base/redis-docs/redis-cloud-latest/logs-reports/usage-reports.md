The **Usage Report** shows the daily memory usage and shard usage of all databases from the subscriptions associated with your account.

![](https://redis.io/docs/latest/images/rc/usage-report-memory-usage.png)

To filter the data, you can:
* Select a month and year from the **View Statement For** list to view the daily memory usage during a specific month.
* Select a subscription from the **Subscription** list to view the daily memory usage of a specific subscription associated with your account.
* Select a database from the **Database** list to view the daily memory usage of a specific database.

You can also hold the pointer over each bar in the graph to view the precise memory usage on that day.

The report gives a breakdown of all your Redis billing unit costs, per subscription and database, by month. Subscriptions under the minimum subscription price are broken down into actual billing unit prices and the difference from minimum price.
