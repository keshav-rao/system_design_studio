The sections below summarize the software and hardware requirements for
an RDI installation.

## Hardware requirements for VM installation

* **CPU**: A minimum of 4 CPU cores. You should consider adding
  2-6 extra cores on top of this if your dataset is big and you want to ingest the
  baseline snapshot as fast as possible.
* **RAM**: 8GB 
* **Disk**: On top of the OS footprint,
  RDI requires 20GB in the `/var` folder and 1GB in the `/opt` folder (to
  store the log files). This allows space for upgrades.
* **Network interface**: 10GB or more.

## OS requirements for VM installation

* RHEL 8 or 9
* Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, or 24.04

## Kubernetes/OpenShift supported versions

RDI only supports versions of Kubernetes and OpenShift that have
not yet reached end-of-life (EOL). See the
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) and
[OpenShift](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift)
lifecycle pages for the latest updates.


## RDI database requirements

* Redis Enterprise v6.4 or greater for the cluster.
* For production, 250MB RAM with one primary and one replica is recommended, but for the
  quickstart or for development, 125MB and a single shard is sufficient.
* If you are deploying RDI for a production environment then secure this database with a password
  and TLS.
* Set the database's
  [eviction policy](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/memory-performance/eviction-policy) to `noeviction`. Note that you can't set this using
  [`rladmin`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin),
  so you must either do it using the admin UI or with the following
  [REST API](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/references/rest-api)
  command:

  ```bash
  curl -v -k -d '{"eviction_policy": "noeviction"}' \
    -u '<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X PUT https://<CLUSTER_FQDN>:9443/v1/bdbs/<BDB_UID>
  ```
* Set the database's
  [data persistence](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/configure/database-persistence)
  to AOF - fsync every 1 sec. Note that you can't set this using
  [`rladmin`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin),
  so you must either do it using the admin UI or with the following
  [REST API](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/references/rest-api)
  commands:

  ```bash
  curl -v -k -d '{"data_persistence":"aof"}' \
    -u '<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
    -X PUT https://<CLUSTER_FQDN>:9443/v1/bdbs/<BDB_UID>
  curl -v -k -d '{"aof_policy":"appendfsync-every-sec"}' \
    -u '<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X PUT https://<CLUSTER_FQDN>:9443/v1/bdbs/<BDB_UID>
  ```
 If you don't have permissions to use AOF persistence, please check the [Using RDI without persistence](https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redis-data-integration/faq#can-i-use-rdi-without-persistence-enabled) section in the FAQ.

* **Ensure that the RDI database is not clustered.** RDI will not work correctly if the
  RDI database is clustered (but note that the target database *can* be clustered without
  any problems).

  When you create the RDI database, expand the **Clustering** section and make sure the
  **Sharding** option is *unchecked* (as shown below).

  ![The Sharding option is unchecked in the Clustering section of the create database form.](https://redis.io/docs/latest/images/rdi/ingest/RDIClusterSetting.webp)

  You can check if your RDI database is clustered from its **Configuration** tab in the
  Cluster Manager UI. In the **Clustering** section, **Sharding** should be set to **Disabled**,
  as shown in the following screenshot:

  ![The Clustering section of the database Configuration tab shows Sharding: Disabled.](https://redis.io/docs/latest/images/rdi/ingest/RDICheckUnclustered.webp)

  If you find the database has been clustered by mistake, you must create a new database with
  sharding disabled before continuing with the RDI installation.
